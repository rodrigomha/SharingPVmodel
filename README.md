# Sharing Economy and Optimal Investment Decisions for Distributed Solar Generation

This repository contains the code to simulate the model presented in the paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid titled "Sharing Economy and Optimal Investment Decisions for Distributed Solar Generation".

The code is written in Python and its organized as follows:

- The src folder contains the functions to run the code. The file solution_algorithms contains the code used to solve all the three models presented in the paper: Standalone model, Sharing Economy model and wholesale market participation model.
- The notebook file contains the instructions and requirements to simulate the code.

The model is based on the following references:
